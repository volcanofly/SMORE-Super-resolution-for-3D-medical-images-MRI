# SMORE and iSMORE: self-supervised super-resolution for 3D medical images

A 
self-supervised super-resolution algorithm for 3D medical images.
It does not require the user to provide any training data.

The code is wrapped and released in IACL website:

Setting iteration number=1 in iSMORE is equivalent to SMORE.
